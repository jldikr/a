AIM: Advanced GIS Operations 1: Nearest Neighbor Analysis, Sampling Raster Data using Points or Polygons, Interpolating Point Data.

A) Nearest Neighbor Analysis:
1. Load the dataset “signif.txt” as a delimited text layer.
2. Load the vector layer “ne_10m_populated_places_simple.zip” and filter for India.
3. Calculate the Distance Matrix and perform Nearest Neighbor Analysis.
4. The InputID field contains the Earthquake layer name, and TargetID contains the closest populated place.
5. The Distance field shows the distance between the two points.
6. Save results as “matrix.csv” and load into QGIS.
7. Right-click the Earthquake layer → Properties → Joins → Add the matrix.csv file.
8. The table now has an attribute with the nearest neighbor and its distance.

B) Sampling Raster Data Using Points and Polygons:
1. Load the raster layer “us.tmax_nohads_ll_{YYYYMMDD}_float.tif”.
2. Identify temperature values at specific points using the Identify tool.
3. Load urban locations data from “2013_Gaz_ua_national.txt”.
4. Install the Point Sampling Tool plugin.
5. Select urban locations as sampling points and extract raster values.
6. The new vector layer will have sampled temperature values.

C) Interpolating Point Data:
1. Load “Arlington_Soundings_2007_stpl83.shp” and “Boundary2004_550_stpl83.shp”.
2. Inspect elevation data values using the Identify tool.
3. Enable the Interpolation plugin and use it to generate elevation surfaces.
4. Create a clipped raster by selecting Raster → Extraction → Clipper.
5. Style the output using color ramps and transparency settings.
6. Generate contour lines using Raster → Extraction → Contours.
7. Label contours based on elevation values.
