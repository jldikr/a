AIM: Managing Data Tables and Spatial Data Sets - Table Joins, Spatial Joins, Points in Polygon Analysis, Performing Spatial Queries.

A) Table Joins:
1. Start a new project.
2. Add the dataset: “I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\A\Data\tl_2013_06_tract.zip”.
3. Import the CSV file and ensure that numeric fields are interpreted correctly.
4. Create a sidecar file with a .csvt extension specifying data types.
5. Save this file in the same directory as the original CSV file.
6. Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer → Select “ca_tracts_pop.csv”.
7. In the Layer panel, right-click on “tl_2013_06_tract” layer and select Properties.
8. In the Properties window, click on "Add Vector Join".
9. In the "Add Vector Join" window, set the properties and click OK.
10. After performing the join, adjust symbology to visualize the data properly.

B) Spatial Joins:
1. Load shapefiles "OEM_NursingHomes_001.shp" and "tl_2013_06_tract.shp".
2. Go to the attribute table and observe data.
3. Perform the spatial join: Vector → Data Management Tools → Join Attributes by Location.
4. View the updated attribute table and inspect results.

C) Points in Polygon Analysis:
1. Load “EarthQuakeDatabase.txt” and "ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip".
2. Use the Select Feature tool to analyze country-wise earthquake distribution.
3. Check the attribute table; a new column "NumPoints" should indicate the count of earthquakes in each country.

D) Performing Spatial Queries:
1. Load vector layers: “ne_10m_populated_places_simple.shp” and “ne_10m_rivers_lake_centerlines.shp”.
2. Go to Vector → Geoprocessing Tool → Buffer.
3. Create a river buffer using appropriate settings.
4. Go to Vector → Research Tool → Select By Location.
5. This will highlight only those rivers that contain a populated place within 2 KM.
