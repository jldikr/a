AIM: Exploring and Managing Raster data: Adding raster layers, raster styling and analysis, raster mosaicking and clipping.

Part 1:
1. Layer → Add Layer → Add Raster Layer.
2. From Practical 2(A) folder, open “glds90g60.asc”.
3. From Layers on the left, right-click on “glds90g60” → Click on Properties.
4. In Properties: Change Render type to “Singleband pseudocolor”, Change Mode to “Equal Interval”, Change the color, then click on “Classify” and then OK.
5. Repeat step 1 and select the file “glds00g60.asc”.
6. Change the Render type, Set the Max value to 240, Change the Mode, Click on classify, then apply and OK.
7. From Layers, select both files by clicking on the box.
8. Click on Raster → Then click on “Raster Calculator”.
9. In Raster Calculator: From the Raster Bands → Select “glds00g60@1” (By double-clicking on it).
10. From the operators, select the “-” operator, then select “glds90g60@1” from the Raster Bands.
11. In the Result Layer, Click on the 3 dots of the output layer.
12. Create a file named “Diff” in the “Practical 2” folder → Click on the “Save” and OK.
13. Then from the layers, go to the properties of the “Diff” file.
14. Repeat step 5, click on classify, and OK.

Part 2:
1. Layer → Add Layer → Add Raster Layer.
2. From Practical 2(C) folder → open “India” folder, select the “4 images”.
3. Raster → Miscellaneous → Merge.
4. In the output file → Create a file named “merged” in the “Practical 2” folder and “Save”.
5. In the input files → Select all the “4 images” selected previously from the “India” folder.
6. Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector Layer → From “IND_adm0.shp” file and open Raster → Extraction → Clipper.
7. In the Input file → Select the “merged” file created previously.
8. In the output file → Create a file named “Clip” and Save.
9. Change the clipping mode to “Mask Layer” and click OK, then close.
